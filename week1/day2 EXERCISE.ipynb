    "Here's the scoop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",

      "Okay, so I need to explain what defines my question... Wait, in the previous example, the user was asking for the definitions of neural networks, attention, and transformers. Now they're saying \"could you please give me the definitions of some core concepts behind LLMs: a neural network, attention and the transformer\". Hmm, maybe I misread this earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, since I need to come up with responses based on my knowledge, let's focus on these topics as per their previous query. First, I remember that in deep learning, a neural network is composed of layers connecting nodes or neurons together, analogous to the way biological neural networks work. The idea came from research at the National Research Council’s Board of Chemical Sciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, for attention mechanisms, it's a process where each element in a sequence attends selectively to others, focusing on relevant parts and helping models perform dimensionality reduction without needing additional parameters or time steps. It's like how attention allows an AI system to pay attention to important parts of the input regardless of their position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding transformers, they use self-attention mechanisms, which are particularly effective with larger-scale models. The key idea is that a model can attend to any part of its input relative to every other part, allowing it to process long-range dependencies by treating sequences as fixed-length inputs where each token has a local view based on the length of the sequence. This creates a highly flexible and powerful architecture without relying on layers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, adding some context: LLMs typically build upon these foundational ideas with improvements like better architectures or more advanced mechanisms. So summarizing, I should explain each concept clearly and succinctly, making sure to tie them together in that broader framework of understanding LLMs.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly! Let me provide clear and concise definitions for the core concepts behind LLMs—neural networks, attention, and transformers:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Neural Network**: A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural systems. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes or neurons that process input data through weighted connections to produce output responses. These networks learn through training on examples, adjusting their internal representation parameters to minimize prediction errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Attention Mechanism**: In the context of LLMs, attention refers to a learning mechanism where each element in an input sequence attends selectively to others. This process enables models to focus on relevant parts of the input regardless of their position or identity, effectively performing dimensionality reduction without requiring additional parameters or time steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Transformer Architecture**: The transformer approach revolutionized deep learning by using self-attention mechanisms. A transformer model processes a sequence as fixed-length inputs where each token has local dependencies based on the sequence's length. These mechanisms enable models to attend to any part of the input relative to every other part, facilitating effective handling of long-range dependencies and creating a highly flexible architecture that doesn't rely on layers.\n",
      "\n",
      "These components form a fundamental building block for large language models (LLMs), significantly advancing machine learning in understanding complex sequential data such as text.\n"
